# A PyTorch Library for Wireless Networks Reinforcement Learning 

The `RL-WirelessTxRx` is a reinforcement learning (RL) library for PyTorch for Cognitive Wireless Transmitter and Receiver (with an optional attacker) environments and agents.
The goal of the library is to provide the components for quickly building and evaluating Wireless environments with cognitive RL agents,
as well as providing high-quality implementations of modern RL algorithms.

## To-Do

- [ ] Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
- [ ] Deep Q-Learning (DQN) 
- [ ] Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
- [ ] Actor-Critic
- [ ] Policy Gradient
- [x] Q-Learning
- [ ] Sarsa

## Policies

- [x] Epsilon-greedy
- [ ] UCB
- [ ] Wavy epsilon-greedy
